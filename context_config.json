By embracing these fundamental values, instructors, students, staff, and administrators create effective academic communities where integrity is at the foundation. Without them, the work of teachers, learners, and researchers loses value and credibility. More than merely abstract principles, the fundamental values serve to inform and improve ethical decision-making capacities and behavior. They enable academic communities to translate ideals into action. [*1]\n\n*1 Source: International Center for Academic Integrity (2014). The Fundamentals of Academic Integrity.

A well-designed course scaffolds student learning levels and encourages reflection to deepen knowledge building (Biggs & Tang, 2011). This student-centered approach fosters autonomy, competence, and a sense of relatedness among students through assessments and activities (Niemiec & Ryan, 2009). Student-centered practices in course design promote authentic learning experiences that support well-being and foundational knowledge (Fink, 2013).\n\n\n\n\nBackward Course Design and learning outcomes\nBook\nAssessments-authentic, formative and summative\nBook\nOpen Education\nBook\nIndigenous Education ~ Course Design\nPage\n\nCourse Workload Estimator\nURL\nadditional resources\nFolder\nCollapse\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\nYour AI resource book\nExploring the Ethics of GenAI\nURL\n \nThis link provides you with the webinar led by Catherine Denial, author of the book \"Pedagogy of Kindness\".

(Webcrawler, 2013).  We will concentrate on electronic media, and provide resources and tips on audio, visual and audio-visual media, and multimedia in learning environments. Not all media is the right choice for every teaching moment. Selecting the right kind of media for your teaching purpose is just as important as the content itself. The SECTIONS model (Bates, 2015) assists educators in choosing the right media for their teaching and learning environment. \n\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Choosing and using media in education: the SECTIONS model\nURL\nMULTIMEDIA: The Magic of Ed Media\nSCORM package\n\nExplore the different options for creating and distributing Educational Media available at Selkirk College.

Freedom of Information Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) guides digital users on how to protect private information and holds accountable organizations and individuals to laws that are enforced to protect digital users. In this section, you will find information about FIPPA and what it means to you as an instructor as well as an internet user. Selkirk College's \"approach to privacy is to ensure the responsible use of information and safeguarding human dignity while optimizing the beneficial use of data for decision-making\" (Selkirk College, 2022). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy\nBook\nAll about Privacy and Why It Matters! - Recording of Oct 26th Workshop\nKaltura Video Resource\nForms for FIPPA compliance\nFolder\nCollapse\nApplied Learning\n\nApplied learning refers to the design of significant learning experiences linked directly with course and program content that intentionally develop students’ academic, personal & professional skills. The hallmarks of applied learning are systems & structures that are flexible and responsive to the unique teaching skills, learning spaces, communication and assessment strategies required to provide authentic, thought-provoking learning experiences that meaningfully contend with current issues facing society, government, business and industry (Camosun College Applied Learning Framework, p.3)\n\nApplied Learning- A Visual\nPage\nSelkirk College Strategic Plan 2025-2040- Applied Learning\nPage\nCollapse\nApplied Learning Assessment Strategies\nHigh Impact Practice (HIP) Reflective ePortfolios\nOpen this document with ReadSpeaker docReader\nInteractive Oral Assessments\nAssessment Strategies \nFile\nOpen this document with ReadSpeaker docReader\nUploaded 12/12/25, 09:17\nWork Integrated Learning- A \"How To\" Guide for Teachers\nBook\nWIL Links\nBook\nAdditional Resources\nFolder\nCollapse\nMental Health in Education\n\nMental health support in post-secondary education plays a crucial role in helping students navigate the challenges of academic life. It involves providing resources and services like counselling and stress management strategies to address issues such as anxiety, depression, and burnout. Instructors can play a key role in supporting learners' mental health by providing information and referrals to services in course materials and during class time. There are a number of resources available for instructors including workshops and trainings that increase mental health literacy and skills for engaging with students and community members.\n\n Effective mental health support promotes students' well-being, enhances their academic performance, and contributes to overall personal growth. It also helps create a supportive campus environment where students and staff feel valued and understood, leading to improved retention and success rates.\n\n\n\n\nTrauma-Informed Pedagogy\nBook\nWellness Wheel \nFile\nOpen this document with ReadSpeaker docReader\nUploaded 9/08/24, 11:26\nIndigenous Education ~ Mental Health\nPage\n\nCollapse\nUniversal Design for Learning (UDL)\n\nUniversal Design for Learning (UDL), is an educational framework promoting accessible learning environments for all students by dismantling physical and cognitive barriers. “Unlike the principle of accommodation, which reactively seeks to provide access to an individual, universal design emphasizes proactive approaches that enhance learning for a wide range of participants. While some accommodations may need to be made on a case-by-case basis, approaching teaching with universal design in mind makes it easier for people with and without disabilities and impairments to participate. The default focus therefore shifts from the individual or the disability to the promotion of inclusion as a general goal” (UT, 2022). \n\nUniversity of Toronto (2022). Fostering Accessible Learning.

Feminist ethics of care is an act of critical thinking \"based on the claim that care and support are just as important functions and outcomes in the university as are efficiency and more measurable outcomes. It is argued that by building strong relations and engaging with each other as full human beings, we can create better and more meaningful processes, results, and impacts (Bergland, 2018). \" (Verdera 2019, p 98). If you are new to Ethics of Care a good starting point to learn about the field of study would be Verdara's 2019 article on Care Ethics in Universities: Beyond an Easy “Add and Stir” Solution. A particular section to read would be: Caring as an Alternative Path, Not Something to Be Added. Nel Noddings is one of the leading voices in this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational resources from Canada\nBook\n500 words - University Resources on Ethics of Care\nPage\nEthics of Care and Critical Pedagogy- Genarro and Carozza \nFile\nOpen this document with ReadSpeaker docReader\n\nAn important article on the intersection between an Ethics of Care, Critical Pedagogy, AI, and Universal Design for Learning.",
