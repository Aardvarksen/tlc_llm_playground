# [PROJECT NAME]

> **🚀 RETURNING TO THIS PROJECT? START HERE:**
> Open Claude Code and say:
> **"I'm back working on [project_name]. Read CLAUDE.md and plan.md for full context, then tell me: where were we and what's our current spotlight?"**
>
> Then come back and read the rest of this README.

**Welcome back, [Your Name].** This is your re-entry guide.

## What This Is

[Brief project description]. But more importantly: this is where you're learning to be an AI-augmented developer.

**Three Goals** (in order of importance):
1. **Learn to work with AI assistants effectively** (meta-skill for career)
2. **Understand every loop and thread deeply** (not just "it works")
3. **Build [specific project goal]** (the actual app)

## Getting Back Into Flow

### Quick Re-Entry (5 minutes)
1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** - Your collaboration contract with Claude
2. **Check `plan.md`** - Where are we in the MVP roadmap?
3. **Read `loops.md`** - Remind yourself of the interaction patterns
4. **Open a Claude Code session** and say: "I'm back! Where were we?"

### Cold Start (haven't touched this in weeks)
1. Read this whole README
2. Read CLAUDE.md thoroughly
3. Review plan.md to see completed vs pending phases
4. Run the app (see below) to remember what it does
5. Check git log to see what changed since you were last here

## How to Run This Thing

[Fill in your project-specific setup and run instructions]

### First Time Setup
```bash
# Add your setup commands here
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Add your run commands here
```

## Your Working Style (Remind Yourself)

**You have ADHD.** You generate a million ideas a minute. This is a strength (curiosity, enthusiasm) and a risk (rabbit holes).

**Claude's job**: Keep you focused on the end goal. Gentle nudging back to the plan when needed.

**Your job**:
- Call out rabbit holes when you feel them forming
- Stream-of-consciousness responses help Claude calibrate
- Ask for the "warm glow" if responses are too laser-focused or too broad

**When you catch yourself sounding knowledgeable about something you don't fully understand**: CALL IT OUT. Your ability to sound smart can make LLMs overestimate your knowledge.

## Key Files to Know

- **CLAUDE.md**: How to work with Claude on this project
- **plan.md**: Where you are in the build, what's next
- **loops.md**: Interaction patterns and workflows
- **[other important files]**: [descriptions]

## What You're Learning

**Technical Skills**:
[List the technical skills this project teaches]

**Meta-Skills**:
- How to structure problems for AI assistance
- When to use AI vs. do it yourself
- How to review/understand/modify AI-generated code
- Collaboration patterns with AI assistants
- Building career-critical skills for the AI-augmented future

## Getting Help

**From Claude**:
1. Open Claude Code
2. Start with: "I'm working on [project_name]. Read CLAUDE.md and plan.md to get context."
3. Ask your question or describe what you want to build

**From Documentation**:
[Add relevant doc links]

## Remember

This project is your vehicle for learning AI-augmented development. The app is the "what", understanding every detail is the "how", but **learning to work effectively with AI is the "why"**.

The subscription stays active because you're building the future. Keep going.
